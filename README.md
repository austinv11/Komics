# Komics [Proof of Concept]
An interactive foreign language teaching system which utilizes comics to increase comprehension.

## Playing
* Note: This game is bound to have bugs due to the limited development time, if the game breaks a restart should fix it.
* Additionally, this requires Java 8 in order to run.
* When starting up you must create a profile with your name, your native language and the language you are learning.
* The main menu allows you to play one of the four mini games.

### Make a Title
The goal of this activity is to create an appropriate title in the language you are learning for the comic based on its context.

Just start typing in order to add a title. Pressing ESC or ENTER will exit the activity.

### Match Captions
This activity contains a comic with no text, based on the context you should pick the most appropriate caption for each of the three panels.

To pick the captions, just click on the one you think is most appropriate for each panel. Pressing ESC or ENTER will exit the activity.
 
### Fill the Panels
This activity provides a comic title and a single panel, it is the task of the user to complete the comic which completes the story in a way that makes sense.

* The paint bucket at the top right corner lets you pick a paint color.
* The pencil icon lets you draw on the screen.
* The eraser icon lets you erase drawn items.
* Scrolling with the mouse wheel will increase or decrease the stroke size.
* Pressing ESC or ENTER will exit the activity.

### Create Custom Comics

* The paint bucket at the top right corner lets you pick a paint color.
* The pencil icon lets you draw on the screen.
* The eraser icon lets you erase drawn items.
